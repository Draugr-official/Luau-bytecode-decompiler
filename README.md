# Luau-bytecode-decompiler
This is a beta version of my luau decompiler in C#, it has been made public for the intention of spreading knowledge. Does not require a lua environemt to run, everything is one single file!

This release is for learning, meaning all code is purposly written bad so the user can learn about bytecode and how you would go about writing a proper and compatible decompiler for it.

## NOTE!

At the last lines of the code, you'll see a function called "isFunction", there you will have to add functions to the function array for it to support more than just print.
